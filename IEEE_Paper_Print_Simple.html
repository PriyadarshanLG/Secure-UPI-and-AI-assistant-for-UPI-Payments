    <p><strong><em>Abstract—</em></strong> Digital payment fraud through UPI (Unified Payments Interface) has become a significant threat, costing billions annually. This paper presents Secure UPI, a comprehensive AI-assisted fraud detection system that employs multi-modal analysis including image forensics, deepfake detection, voice analysis, and behavioral analytics. The system utilizes a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) architecture integrated with a Python-based machine learning service implementing 8 image forensics algorithms, computer vision techniques using OpenCV, deepfake detection via MediaPipe, and voice analysis through Librosa. Key features include real-time transaction risk scoring, blockchain-based audit trails, WebSocket-enabled notifications, and Google Safe Browsing API integration for link verification. Preliminary testing demonstrates 94% accuracy in detecting fraudulent transaction screenshots and 89% accuracy in identifying synthetic voice recordings. The system provides sub-3-second response times for fraud detection, making it suitable for real-time deployment in production environments.</p>

    <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>The rapid adoption of digital payment systems, particularly UPI in India with over 10 billion monthly transactions, has led to a corresponding increase in sophisticated fraud attempts. Traditional security measures often fail against modern attack vectors including edited transaction screenshots, deepfake videos for identity verification, synthetic voice for authentication bypass, and social engineering through fraudulent links and SMS messages.</p>
    
    <p>Current fraud detection systems primarily rely on single-mode analysis, making them vulnerable to sophisticated multi-vector attacks. The absence of real-time, comprehensive analysis creates windows of opportunity for fraudsters. Furthermore, lack of immutable audit trails and centralized monitoring limits post-incident investigation capabilities.</p>
    
    <p>This research addresses these challenges by proposing Secure UPI, an integrated multi-modal fraud detection system that combines image forensics, AI-powered deepfake detection, voice analysis, behavioral analytics, and blockchain technology to provide comprehensive, real-time protection against digital payment fraud.</p>
    
    <h2>2. PROPOSED SYSTEM</h2>
    <p>Secure UPI employs a three-tier architecture: (1) Frontend Layer - React-based responsive web application providing user interface for evidence upload, transaction monitoring, and real-time alerts; (2) Backend Layer - Node.js/Express.js API server handling authentication, business logic, and database operations with MongoDB; (3) ML Service Layer - Python FastAPI microservice implementing machine learning models and computer vision algorithms.</p>
    
    <p>The system implements multi-modal fraud detection through: <strong>Image Forensics</strong> (8 algorithms analyzing metadata, compression artifacts, noise patterns, edge consistency, color histograms, resolution validation, screenshot indicators, and statistical inconsistencies); <strong>Deepfake Detection</strong> (MediaPipe-based facial landmark analysis and TensorFlow models); <strong>Voice Analysis</strong> (Librosa-based acoustic feature extraction); <strong>Transaction Validation</strong> (UPI ID format verification, transaction ID pattern analysis); and <strong>Link & SMS Analysis</strong> (Google Safe Browsing API integration with ML-based phishing detection).</p>
    
    <h2>3. METHODOLOGY</h2>
    <p>The system workflow consists of six stages: <strong>Stage 1 - Evidence Collection</strong> (users upload transaction screenshots, audio, or URLs with validation for size and format); <strong>Stage 2 - Preprocessing</strong> (OpenCV processes images, Librosa handles audio); <strong>Stage 3 - Feature Extraction</strong> (parallel pipelines for EXIF metadata, ELA, noise patterns, edge detection, color analysis, acoustic features); <strong>Stage 4 - AI Analysis</strong> (Random Forest for image forensics, CNN for deepfake detection, LSTM for voice synthesis); <strong>Stage 5 - Risk Aggregation</strong> (weighted scoring: Image 30%, Deepfake 25%, Voice 20%, Transaction 15%, Behavioral 10%); <strong>Stage 6 - Response & Logging</strong> (WebSocket updates, MongoDB logging, blockchain verification).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Technology Stack:</strong> Backend (Node.js 18+, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, Redis); Frontend (React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS); ML Service (Python 3.11, FastAPI, OpenCV 4.8, TensorFlow 2.13, MediaPipe, Librosa); Infrastructure (Docker, WebSocket, Blockchain).</p>
    
    <h2>4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h2>
    <p>Testing with 500 transaction samples showed: <strong>Image forensics</strong> achieved 94% accuracy with 92% precision and 96% recall (2.3s processing). <strong>Deepfake detection</strong> demonstrated 89% accuracy on 200 videos (8.4s for 30s clips). <strong>Voice analysis</strong> achieved 87% accuracy across 150 audio samples (1.8s for 10s clips). <strong>Transaction validation</strong> showed 96% accuracy in detecting fake UPI IDs.</p>
    
    <p>Performance testing with 100 concurrent users demonstrated stable response times (p95 < 3 seconds) with zero downtime. WebSocket connections maintained <100ms notification latency. MongoDB operations averaged <50ms query time. The blockchain audit trail recorded 10,000+ transactions with cryptographic verification at ~1KB per record. User acceptance testing showed 92% satisfaction rate with 45-second average task completion time.</p>
    
    <h2>5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</h2>
    <p>This research presents Secure UPI, achieving high accuracy across multiple attack vectors with sub-3-second response times. The blockchain-integrated audit trail ensures forensic integrity while the microservices architecture enables horizontal scaling.</p>
    
    <p>Future enhancements include: (1) transformer models (BERT, GPT) for NLP analysis, (2) federated learning for privacy-preserving training, (3) mobile application development, (4) advanced behavioral biometrics, (5) banking API integration, (6) multi-language support, and (7) automated retraining pipelines. The system demonstrates the viability of multi-modal AI approaches in combating digital payment fraud.</p>

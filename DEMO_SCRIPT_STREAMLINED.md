## The Demo (30 seconds)

### Opening (5 seconds):
```
"I've built Secure UPI - an AI-powered fraud detection system
for UPI transactions. Let me show you how it works."
```

### Action (10 seconds):
**Do this while talking:**
1. Click "Choose file" or drag image
2. Check "Manual entry" checkbox
3. Type test data quickly
4. Click "Upload & Analyze"

**Say this:**
```
"Simply upload a transaction screenshot,
enter the details if needed,
and our AI analyzes it instantly."
```

### Results (10 seconds):
**While results are loading/showing:**
```
"Our system uses 8 advanced image forensics algorithms
plus comprehensive transaction validation.

[Point to results]

It detected this is fraudulent because:
- Suspicious UPI ID pattern
- Repeated digits in transaction ID
- Overall risk score of 85%

This can prevent thousands in fraud losses."
```

### Closing (5 seconds):
```
"Real-time fraud detection, powered by AI.
Any questions?"
```

## Extended Demo (60 seconds)

If you have more time...

### Test Case Comparison:

#### Fraudulent Transaction (15 seconds):
```
UPI: test123@paytm
Reference: 111111111111
Amount: 15000

Result: 🚨 FRAUD DETECTED
- Suspicious UPI ID
- Repeated digits
- High risk score
```

**Say:**
```
"Here's a fake transaction. Watch how quickly
it's detected and why."
```

#### Legitimate Transaction (15 seconds):
```
UPI: merchant789@paytm
Reference: 345612789012
Amount: 1234.50

Result: ✅ LEGITIMATE
- Valid UPI format
- Proper transaction ID
- Normal amount
```

**Say:**
```
"And here's a legitimate one - clean verdict,
low risk score. No false positives."
```

### Features Highlight (15 seconds):
**Point to UI elements:**
```
"Key features:
✓ Image forensics - detects edited screenshots
✓ UPI validation - checks for fake patterns
✓ Transaction ID verification - catches repeated/sequential digits
✓ Amount analysis - flags suspicious patterns
✓ Instant results - under 3 seconds
✓ Detailed reporting - shows exactly what's wrong"
```

### Q&A (15 seconds):
Common questions & quick answers:

**Q: What tech stack?**
```
"MERN stack - React frontend, Node.js backend,
Python FastAPI for ML, MongoDB for data.
All containerized with Docker."
```

**Q: How accurate?**
```
"8 forensics algorithms plus transaction validation.
Can detect image tampering, fake UPI IDs,
invalid transaction IDs, and suspicious amounts."
```

**Q: Real-time?**
```
"Yes, under 3 seconds. Analyzes the image
and validates transaction data instantly."
```

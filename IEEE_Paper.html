    <div class="abstract-body">
        The exponential growth of digital payment systems has led to a corresponding increase in fraudulent activities, 
        particularly in Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions. This paper presents a comprehensive AI-assisted 
        fraud detection system designed to secure UPI payments through multi-layered verification mechanisms. The proposed 
        system integrates advanced machine learning algorithms, image forensics analysis, real-time risk assessment, 
        blockchain-based transaction logging, and SMS fraud detection to provide a robust security framework. Built on 
        the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack with Python-based microservices, the system achieves fraud 
        detection accuracy through multiple validation layers including UPI ID verification, transaction pattern analysis, 
        deepfake detection, and behavioral analytics. The platform features role-based access control, real-time WebSocket 
        alerts, device telemetry monitoring, and comprehensive audit logging. Experimental results demonstrate significant 
        improvement in fraud detection rates with reduced false positives, providing enhanced security for digital payment

    <div class="body-text">
        The digital payment revolution in India, particularly through the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), has 
        transformed financial transactions, processing billions of transactions annually. However, this rapid digitization 
        has created opportunities for sophisticated fraud schemes including fake transaction screenshots, phishing attacks, 
        SMS scams, and identity theft. Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems struggle to keep pace with evolving 
        attack vectors.
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        The motivation behind this research stems from the critical need to protect users from financial fraud while 
        maintaining transaction efficiency. Current challenges include: (i) detection of manipulated transaction screenshots, 
        (ii) identification of fake UPI IDs and merchant profiles, (iii) real-time risk assessment of transactions, 
        (iv) SMS-based phishing attacks, and (v) lack of transparent, immutable transaction records.

    <div class="body-text">
        <b>Problem Statement:</b> To develop an intelligent, multi-layered fraud detection system that can identify 
        fraudulent UPI transactions in real-time through AI-powered analysis, image forensics, behavioral pattern 
        recognition, and blockchain verification.
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        <b>Objectives:</b> (1) Implement real-time fraud detection using machine learning algorithms, (2) Develop image 
        forensics capabilities for screenshot verification, (3) Create behavioral analytics for transaction pattern analysis,

    <div class="subsection-heading">3.2 Fraud Detection Algorithm</div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        The system implements a hierarchical fraud detection approach: <b>Step 1 - Data Extraction:</b> OCR extracts 
        UPI ID, transaction reference number, amount, timestamp, and merchant details from uploaded screenshots using 
        Tesseract OCR engine. <b>Step 2 - UPI Validation:</b> Pattern matching identifies test/fake/dummy keywords, 
        sequential numbers (123456), repeated digits, and validates provider domains (paytm, phonepe, googlepay, etc.) 
        against whitelist.
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        <b>Step 3 - Transaction ID Analysis:</b> Detects suspicious patterns including repeated digits (111111111111), 
        sequential patterns (123456789012), and validates length constraints (standard 12 digits). <b>Step 4 - Amount 
        Pattern Recognition:</b> Flags suspiciously round amounts (multiples of 1000, 5000, 10000), unusually high 
        transactions deviating from statistical norms, and compares against user's historical spending patterns using 
        z-score analysis.
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        <b>Step 5 - Image Forensics:</b> Eight parallel algorithms analyze: (a) Compression artifacts using discrete 
        cosine transform, (b) Metadata inconsistencies in EXIF headers, (c) EXIF data validation for camera model and 
        timestamp, (d) Edge detection anomalies using Canny edge detection, (e) Color space irregularities in RGB/HSV 
        analysis, (f) Resolution mismatches and aspect ratio validation, (g) Screenshot detection through pixel patterns, 
        (h) Statistical properties using chi-square analysis.
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        <b>Step 6 - Risk Scoring:</b> Weighted aggregation combining multiple factors: Risk Score = w1×(UPI_validity) + 
        w2×(Transaction_ID_validity) + w3×(Amount_pattern) + w4×(Image_forensics) + w5×(Behavioral_score) + 
        w6×(Device_trust) + w7×(Geolocation_risk) + w8×(Velocity_check), where weights are dynamically optimized based 
        on historical fraud data using gradient descent. <b>Step 7 - Verdict Generation:</b> Risk Score ≥ 40: FRAUD 
        DETECTED (immediate alert); Risk Score ≥ 30: SUSPICIOUS (manual review); Risk Score &lt; 30: LEGITIMATE 
        (transaction approved).
